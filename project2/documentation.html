    <h3>Scope</h3>
    <p>When I read the space colonization algorithm
        <a href="algorithmicbotany.org/papers/colonization.egwnp2007.pdf">(downloadable pdf)</a>
        I was pretty inspired to create something similar in three.js. I wanted to experiment more with three.js, because I didn't
        end up using it in my first project. I also implmented the OrbitControls.js, something we didn't do (at least I think
        we didnt), and I tried doing a skybox, which was kind of fun to do.
    </p>
    <p>I originally wanted to create something that would cycle through a bunch of different scenes, but that did not end up
        panning out because I implemented the skybox and animations instead.</p>
    <h3>Problems</h3>
    <p>I easily spent the most time on the algorithm itself. It was pretty difficult because I ran into a lot of issues trying
        to place the objects -- I was ultimately passing in a Vector 3 into a function that only accepted three seperate
        float values. I also continiously run into a problem where objects might be slightly too far from their parent branch.
        </p>
    <p>I chose to show the original canopy of generated leaves first because it is easier to visualize how the tree is creating
        each part.
    </p>
    <h3>User Interaction</h3>
    <p>The user can move around the screen and look at the /poorly/ seamed together skybox. They can also toggle the original
        canopy of leaves on and off. </p>
