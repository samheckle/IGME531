    <h1>Project 1 Documentation</h1>
    <a href="./index.html">Project 1</a>
    <h3>Scope</h3>
    <p>The initial idea was based on Casey Reas's compendium, specifically using
        <a href='artport.whitney.org/commissions/softwarestructures2016/s3_process_10/'>this</a>
        as a direct example. I wanted to do a series of different shapes and have the user interact with them. Reas takes the intersections
        between circles and draws the lines corresponding between them. I used not only circles, but also squares. I also
        wanted to use sound, however this was axed as all of the audio sounded really terrible when trying to implement it
        using the intersections.</p>
    <h3>Aesthetic Decisions</h3>
    <p>The most difficult part of the project was implementing the Reas algorithm. After that, it was deciding what shapes to
        use. I landed on using the original circle and squares, because they both had a uniform shape and it would be less
        computationally intensive to calculate them. </p>
    <p>I also chose two seperate background colors. This was in part to generate more user interaction, but to also add some
        color to the work. Instead of using sound, I implemented color. These colors were picked partly at random, but also
        on their buildability and contrast.
    </p>
    <p>
        I thought it would be interesting to allow the user to have more direct interaction by using the mouse. By clicking on one
        half or the other, the user will generate either the circles or the squares, respectively. By moving the mouse around
        the screen, it will change not only the background color but the trails generated by the intersections.
    </p>
    <h3>User Interaction</h3>
    <p>There are two things the user must do for the simulation to work as intended. First, when the webpage loads, choose the
        shape they want to generate the intersections. From there, they can move the mouse around the screen to change the
        colors of the trails and the background color. </p>
    <p>The user can also reset the page by pressing the reset button in the gui. They can also resart the simulation by clicking
        on either side, re-generating either the circles or the squares depending on which side they click. </p>
